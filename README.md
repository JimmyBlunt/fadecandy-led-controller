# fadecandy-led-controller
A balenaCloud setup for Fadecandy and Glediator.

Note: this application requires the separate download of Glediator from: http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/software/glediator. Add the downloaded Glediator_V2.jar and the lib folder to the root of the glediator folder within this project before pushing your code to balenaCloud.
