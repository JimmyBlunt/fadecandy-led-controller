# Fadecandy WS2811 LED Controller
This project provides a VNC or web-client VNC interface to Glediator, which ultimately allows you to control an array of WS2811 or compatible RGB LED pixels/neopixels via an Adafruit Fadecandy board.

The project is set up and configured to run with a 25x10 matrix based on 5 folded strings of 50 LEDs each. This is entirely configurable, and there's more information in [this blog post](https://www.balena.io/blog/build-festive-lighting-for-the-holidays-with-balena/) that explains how.

**Note:** this project includes freely available software (Glediator) from [solderlab.de](https://solderlab.de). At the time of writing the site is currently down and so we have mirrored the download within this project. This will be removed upon request by the author or when the site comes back online.
